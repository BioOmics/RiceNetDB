# RiceNetDB

## 1. Introduction
RiceNetDB is a genome-scale comprehensive regulatory database on Oryza sativa. It was displayed on three levels: genome-scale metabolic network (GEM), protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to facilitate biomolecular regulatory analysis and gene-metabolite mapping. The multiple-level model was localized into ten cellular compartments: mitochondrion, vacuole, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, Endoplasmic Reticulum, extracellular, nucleus, chloroplast, plasma membrane and peroxisome. In current version, it stores 4,462 metabolic associated genes, 2,986 metabolites, 3,316 reactions, 90,358 pairs of protein-protein interactions, 662,936 pairs of gene regulations and 1,763 microRNA-target interactions. RiceNetDB enables users to retrieve and visualize gene-centric multiple level networks of rice. RiceNetDB Analysis modules enable users to perform the dataset analysis including "Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis", "Sublocation Analysis", "Pathway Analysis" and "Network Analysis".
